# Heap Implementation

This project implements a generic **Heap** class in Python.

This Python implementation supports:
- A **generic heap** structure, allowing for various data types (can store floats, int, custom datastructure).
- The **min-heap** property where the smallest element is always the root.
- Heap operations:
  - **Inserting** new elements into the heap.
  - **Popping** the root element and restoring the heap property.
  - **Building a min-heap** from an unsorted/ random array.
  - **Retrieving the root** element of the heap without removal.
