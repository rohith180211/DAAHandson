Post a link to your github repository(s) with the source code.

Argue selection sort correctness. Solution: DAA Hands On 2/Correctnessofselectionsort.pdf

Benchmark the runtime of each algorithm. Your benchmarks should include information about your computer (ram, cpu etc.) and be run with various input sizes; from small (array of size 5,10,20) all the way up to large arrays (where your computer is struggling). I should at the very least see a plot of time vs input size n. Feel free to use benchmarking software.
