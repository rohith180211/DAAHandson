# Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, and AVL Tree Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of three different tree data structures:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A basic, unbalanced binary search tree.
- **Red-Black Tree (RBT)**: A balanced binary search tree using color properties and rotations.
- **AVL Tree**: A balanced binary search tree using height-based rotations.

Each tree implementation includes the following operations:
- **Insertion**
- **Deletion**
- **Search**
- **In-order Traversal**
