# Data Structures & Quicksort Implementation

**Name:** Rohith Janwadkar  
**Student ID:** 1002226469  

## Description
This repository contains implementations of basic data structures (Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List) using fixed-sized arrays, as well as a solution to finding the i-th order statistic using the Quicksort algorithm. All data structures assume integer storage and are implemented using C-style arrays.

## Contents

### Quicksort Implementation for i-th Order Statistic
- **Description:** This task leverages the Quicksort algorithm to implement a solution for finding the i-th smallest element in an unsorted array.
- **Average Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

### Data Structures: Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List
- **Description:** Basic implementations of Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List, which simulate the behavior of these structures using fixed-size arrays. 
- **Key Operations:**
  - **Stack:** push, pop, peek
  - **Queue:** enqueue, dequeue, peek
  - **Singly Linked List:** insert, delete, display
